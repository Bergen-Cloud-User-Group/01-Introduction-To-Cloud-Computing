# Lab 04 - Launching a MySQL Database
![Lab 04 Banner](GFX/Lab04.png)

## Welcome!
In this lab, we'll be launching a MySQL database using AWS managed database service, RDS.
This lab is, as long as you are eligable, still within the free-tier.

We will also demonstrate how you can allow an EC2 instance access to the MySQL server, and block the rest of the internet.

## Before You Begin

* You will need a working EC2 instance in order to connect to the MySQL database. If you have terminated the instance from the previous lab, you will need to create a new one.

## Getting Started
### 1. Lab Steps

All the steps required to complete the lab.
